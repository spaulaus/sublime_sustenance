	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		I'm Stanley P. I learned to bake from my Grandmother and cook from my Dad.
		I hate when food blogs spend 45 minutes talking about the food. I'd rather just have the recipe.
		I started this out as a printed book, but I find that's getting harder to maintain.

		First, let us reflect on our own work and the effort of those who brought us this food. <br><br>
		Second, let us be aware of the quality of our deeds as we receive this meal. <br><br>
		Third, what is most essential is the practice of mindfulness, which helps us to transcend greed, anger and delusion. <br><br>
		Fourth, we appreciate this food which sustains the good health of our body and mind. <br><br>
		Fifth, in order to continue our practice for all beings we accept this offering. <br><br>
		The first morsel is to cut all delusions.<br>
		The second morsel is to maintain our clear mind.<br>
		The third morsel is to save all sentient beings.<br>
		May we awaken together with all beings.<br>
