	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		I'm Stanley P. I learned to bake from my Grandmother and cook from my Dad.
		They've been huge influence on my life, and it's safe to say I wouldn't be
		where I'm at without both of them. You'll find some recipes sprinkled through
		here from them.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hate when food blogs spend 45 minutes talking about the food. No, I don't
		care that you found this recipe while backpacking naked through the rainforest.
		I couldn't care less that it changed your whole world view. I just want to know
		how to make those cookies.
	</p>
	<p>
		That said, I collect these recipes from all over the place. My favorite recipes are
		those that I get from my co-workers and friends. I've been lucky to work with people
		from many different cultures. I always like to get to know them through the food that
		they love. If you've contributed to this cookbook, I thank you.

		I started this out as a printed book, but I find that's getting harder to maintain.
		It's also getting expensive to print. Why kill trees in the digital age?

		First, let us reflect on our own work and the effort of those who brought us this food. <br><br>
		Second, let us be aware of the quality of our deeds as we receive this meal. <br><br>
		Third, what is most essential is the practice of mindfulness, which helps us to transcend greed, anger and delusion. <br><br>
		Fourth, we appreciate this food which sustains the good health of our body and mind. <br><br>
		Fifth, in order to continue our practice for all beings we accept this offering. <br><br>
		The first morsel is to cut all delusions.<br>
		The second morsel is to maintain our clear mind.<br>
		The third morsel is to save all sentient beings.<br>
		May we awaken together with all beings.<br>
