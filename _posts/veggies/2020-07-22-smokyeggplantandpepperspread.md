        * 1 poblano chile

        1. Prepare a moderate charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium (375 F). Place the eggplants, sweet pepper, poblano chile and tomatoes directly over the coals or gas flame. Cover the grill and cook, turning the vegetables occasionally, until the skins are blackened and the vegetables are soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool.
        1. Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise and scrape the flesh away from the skin     with a spoon. Peel and core the sweet pepper and poblano chile and discard the seeds. Peel and core the tomatoes.
        1. Chop all the grilled vegetables together to a near puree. Transfer to a bowl. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the olive oil.
        1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over moderately low heat. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant and just beginning to color, about 1 minute.
        1. Add the garlic and oil in the skillet to the vegetables. Stir in the cilantro, cumin, and vinegar and season with salt. Set the spread aside for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend, or cover and refrigerate for up to 8 hours, then bring to room temperature before serving.
