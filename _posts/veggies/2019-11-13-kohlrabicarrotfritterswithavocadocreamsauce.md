        * 2 kohlrabi (for Kossack: use about 1/2 of a 10'' specimen)
        * 1 carrot
        * 1 egg
        * 0.25 teaspoon kosher salt
        * 0.25 teaspoon cayenne
        * 0.5 cup grapeseed or vegetable oil (enough for 0.25-inch depth in a large skillet)
        * 0.5 avocado
        * 0.25 cup plain yogurt
        * 0.5 lemon
        * 0.25 teaspoon kosher salt
        * Green onions (for garnish)

        1. Cut the leaves off of the kohlrabi, and peel the bulb. Peel the carrot. Shred the vegetables in a food processor (quick and easy!) or using a grater. Squeeze the shredded vegetables in a tea cloth (or with your hands) to remove moisture, then add to a bowl with 1 egg, 0.25 teaspoon kosher salt, 0.25 teaspoon cayenne, and mix to combine.
        1. Place 0.5 cup oil in a large skillet (enough for 0.25-inch depth). Heat the oil over medium high heat, then place balls of the fritter mixture into the oil. Fry on one side until browned, then fry on the other side. Remove and place on a plate lined with a paper towel to drain excess oil.
        1. In a small bowl, mix 0.5 avocado, 0.25 cup plain yogurt, juice from 0.5 lemon, and 0.25 teaspoon kosher salt to make the sauce (or blend together in a food processor).
        1. Serve fritters with avocado cream sauce and sliced green onions, if desired.

These fritters are best eaten warm the day of making; they don't save well. Like anything made with avocado, the 
avocado cream sauce will become brown after exposure to air. Make sure to cover the surface with plastic wrap when 
storing.
