From Mastering the Art of French Cooking: Vol. 1 by Julia Child
"Leek and potato soup smells good, tastes good, and is simplicity itself to make. It is also versatile as a soup base; 
add water cress and you have a water-cress soup, or stir in cream and chill it for vichyssoise. To change the formula 
a bit, add carrots, string beans, cauliflower, broccoli, or anything else you think would go with it, and vary the 
proportions as you wish." - Julia Child
