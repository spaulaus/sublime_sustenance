        * Place the potatoes in one saucepan and the celery root and apples in another. Add salt to taste to each, about 1/2 teaspoon. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
        * Drain the potatoes, and return to the pot. Cover tightly, and allow to sit for five minutes to steam and dry out. Drain the celery root and apples through a strainer set over a bowl. Pur\'ee all of the produce using a food mill or a potato ricer. Stir together, and whisk in the milk or the broth until the mixture is fluffy. Add the butter or walnut oil to the hot pur√©e, stir until the butter melts, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
