        * 1 Egg

        1. Rinse the quinoa under cold water for a couple of minutes and place in a pot with 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 12 minutes then turn off the heat and let stand, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. Remove the cover and allow to cool to room temperature.
        1. Add the olive oil, garlic and diced onions to a pan and saute on medium heat until translucent. Grate the zucchini on a box grater, squeeze the excess water out and add to the pan. Toss together with the onion and garlic and remove from the heat to cool. When ready, add the onion/zucchini mixture to the cooked quinoa along with the corn kernels and herbs. Season to taste, add the egg and flour and mix thoroughly.
        1. I found it's easiest to form thick, uniform cakes by using a round 3 1/2" cookie cutter. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, place the cutter on the paper and spoon the mixture into it until it comes up about halfway. Gently slip off the cutter and repeat. Bake in a 400 F oven for 15 minutes, flip and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Makes about 8 cakes or 4 servings.
