        1. Heat butter or oil over medium heat in a very large, deep skillet or Dutch oven. Add seeds, and saute until they begin to pop, about 5 minutes.
        1. Add onion, salt, turmeric and cayenne. Cook, stirring occasionally for 8-10 minutes, or until the onions are translucent.
        1. Add eggplant and salt. Cook, stirring from the bottom regularly, for 15-20 minutes- until the eggplant is soft. You might need to add a little water if the mixture is too dry. Cover the pan between stirrings.
        1. Steam the peas until they are just tender and bright green. Serve the curry over rice, topped with peas and freshly minced cilantro.
