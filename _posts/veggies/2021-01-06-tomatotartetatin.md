        * 2 medium yellow onions, chopped
        * 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or clarified butter
        * 1 1/2 pounds small or cherry tomatoes
        * scant 1/2 teaspoon fine grain sea salt
        * 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
        * a bit of flour
        * zest of one lemon
        * 1 pie crust, see pg. \pageref{grandmaspiecrust}
        * 1 egg whisked with a tablespoon of water

        1. Preheat the oven to 400 F
        1. While the oven is warming, uses a large skillet over medium heat to saut√© the onions and a couple pinches of salt in the oil/clarified butter. Cook, stirring regularly, until the onions are deeply golden and caramelized, 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat.
        1. While the onions are cooking, cut any larger tomatoes in half. I typically leave the small cherry tomatoes whole. Add to the caramelized onions along with the sea salt and balsamic vinegar. Transfer to a 10 or 11-inch cast iron skillet or equivalent deep pie dish. If you get the sense that your tomatoes are quite juicy, and might release a lot of liquid, you can toss the mixture with a tablespoon or two of flour at this point. Sprinkle mixture with lemon zest.
        1. Roll out your pie dough, and use it to cover the tomato mixture - tucking in the sides a bit. Brush the crust with the egg wash, cut a few decorative slits in the crust, and bake in the top third of the oven until the crust is deeply golden and the tomatoes are bubbling a bit at the sides, 25 - 30 minutes.
