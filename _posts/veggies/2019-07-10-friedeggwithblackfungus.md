        1. Soak the dry black fungus in cold water for 20-30 minutes until they fully expand. Clean them well, and trim off the stems with scissors. Tear them into small pieces, and set aside.
        1. Wash and peel the carrot, and then cut it into thin diamond-shaped slices. Place onto a plate.
        1. Crack the eggs into a bowl or a small basin. Beat it up.
        1. Heat some oil in the wok and add the beaten eggs. Stir-fry for a few seconds until the eggs set. Turn off the heat, remove the eggs and set aside.
        1. Heat some more oil and add the green onions and stir-fry for ten seconds until fragrant. Add the carrot slices and black fungus and stir-fry over high heat for about one minute. Add the salt and pepper and cook another twenty seconds. Turn the heat to low, add the eggs and stir-fry for another thirty seconds.
        1. Turn off the heat, remove the contents from the wok and serve on a fine porcelain plate.
