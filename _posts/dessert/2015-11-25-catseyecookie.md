        1. Heat oven to 425 F. In a large bowl, cut butter into flour as for pie dough. Add vanilla sugar and sour cream, and bring together quickly. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for 2 hours.
        1. On a parchment-lined baking sheet, roll dough thinly and cut into circles of the diameter you wish, leaving 1 inch between. Using a smaller, round cutter, cut the center out of half the circles. Remove scraps, reroll and cut more cookies. Bake 10-15 minutes or until turning lightly brown around the edges.
        1. When the cookies have cooled, sprinkle confectioners' sugar on those with holes and spread a light layer of jam on the whole cookies. Press them together lightly, confectioners' sugar and jam sides up. When set, store tightly covered.
