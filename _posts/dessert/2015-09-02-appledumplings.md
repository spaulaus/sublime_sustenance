        * Core and peel apple into eight slices. (I used one of these handy little apple slicers and got the job done in one whack.)
        * Open can of crescent rolls and unroll. Place one apple slice on the wide end of one crescent and roll it up in the crescent.
        * Place into a greased 8x8 (or 9x9) pan. Continue with other rolls.
        * In a small bowl combine melted butter, sugar, cinnamon, and flour and mix until just combined.
        * Spoon over each crescent.
        * Pour Sprite into empty space in the middle of pan (NOT over the crescents).
        * Bake at 350 F for 35 to 40 minutes or until crescents are golden brown.
        * Serve warm with fresh whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
