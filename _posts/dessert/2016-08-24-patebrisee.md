        1. Pulse flour and sugar in a food processor (or whisk together by hand in bowl). Add butter, and pulse, or use pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal, with some larger pieces remaining. Drizzle 1/4 cup water over mixture, pulse (or mix with fork), until the mixture begins to hold together. If it seems too dry, add another 1/4 cup of water, 1 tbs. at a time and pulse again.
        1. Turn out onto counter, and wrap in plastic wrap tightly, chilling for about one hour, or overnight.
