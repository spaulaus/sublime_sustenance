    servings: 6 (~12 oz)
    prep: 15 minutes
    cook: 15 minutes
    ingredients_markdown: |-
        * 1 1/2 cups very finely ground blanched almond flour/meal
        * 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
        * 2 teaspoons quality pure almond extract
        * 1 teaspoon quality food grade rose water
        * 1 egg white

        1. Place the almond flour and powdered sugar in a food processor and pulse until combined and any lumps are broken up. 
        2. Add the almond extract and rose water and pulse to combine. 
        3. Add the egg white and process until a thick dough is formed. If the mass is still too wet and sticky, add more powdered sugar and ground almonds. Keep in mind that it will become firmer after it's been refrigerated.
        2. Turn the almond marzipan out onto a work surface and knead it a few times. Form it into a log, wrap it up in plastic wrap and refrigerate.
        3. Will keep for at least a month in the refrigerator or up to 6 months in the freezer. Bring to room temperature before using in any recipe.
