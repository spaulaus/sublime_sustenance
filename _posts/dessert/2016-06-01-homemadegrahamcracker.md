        * 1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
        * 1 large egg
        * 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar
        * 1/4 cup honey
        * 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
        * 2 teaspoons water
        * 3/4 teaspoon salt
        * 1.5 graham flour
        * 3/4 C all-purpose flour

        1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
        1. Combine the butter, egg and sugar in a bowl and beat until smooth and creamy.
        1. Stir in the honey and blend.
        1. Dissolve the baking soda in the water and add to the butter mixture.
        1. Add the salt, graham flour, and all-purpose flour to the mixture and blend thoroughly. The dough should hold together and be manageable. If it is too "tacky" add a little more graham flour.
        1. Liberally dust a surface with graham flour and roll the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. For convenience in handling, cut the rolled dough into three or four sections that will fit on your cookie sheet. (To make my life easier, line cookie sheets with parchment paper and roll the dough directly on the cookie sheets. That way you don't need to worry about the dough breaking when you lift it onto a cookie sheet.)
        1. With a knife, score the dough, without cutting through, into 2 1/2 inch squares. (Boring! Since your graham crackers are not store-bought, they don't have to be square. Use your cookie cutters to make them any shape you want!)
        1. Prick each square a few times with the tines of a fork. (I did this because those little pricks do make them look like graham crackers, whatever shape they are.)
        1. Using a spatula, place the sections of scored cracker dough on an ungreased cookie sheet. (I didn't have to do this since I rolled right on the cookie sheet.)
        1. Bake on the first side for 8 minutes, then turn the cracker over and bake for another 6 or 7 minutes. (Cheryl of Free Range Living said that she found that flipping wasn't necessary. I agree. I left out the flip step.)
        1. Remove from the oven and cool on racks. (They weren't quite crispy when I removed them. However, they hardened up as soon as they cooled.)

 Some graham crackers use half honey and half molasses. You might consider trying that as a variation.
 If you can't get ahold of graham flour, there are plenty of graham cracker recipes that use regular whole wheat flour. 
 You may also be able to directly substitute whole wheat flour in this recipe, but I haven't tested it and I make no 
 promises.
