        1. Divide dough evenly into 8 pieces ( I made 6 slightly larger ones ). On a lightly floured surface roll out each piece into a 7 inch round, 1/8 inch thick. Transfer to parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. arranging several inches apart.
        1. In large bowl, combine rhubarb, strawberries, cornstarch and sugar.
        1. Cover each round of dough with a heaping 1/2 cup mixture, leaving a 1-inch border. Fold the edges over the filing, leaving the opening in the center. Refrigerate 30 minutes, or until firm.
        1. Preheat oven to 400 F. Brush edges with egg wash, one egg beaten, and sprinkle with sanding sugar. bake until crusts are golden brown about 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 F, and bake until juices start to bubble and run from center, about 15 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let cool and transfer to wire rack.
