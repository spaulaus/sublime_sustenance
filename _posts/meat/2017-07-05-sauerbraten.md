        1. Sprinkle meat well with salt and pepper and rub in thoroughly.
        1. Place with onions, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a deep earthen dish (I use a tupperware marinade container that is made for flipping since the seal is in middle of dish).
        1. Heat water and vinegar (I like it sour so we use almost all vinegar). Add salt and sugar to taste. Pour hot over meat to cover.
        1. Refrigerate letting it stand at least 3-4 days (can be as long as 7 day) flipping it every 12 hours or so.
        1. Put meat in kettle, add onion slices and a little of the spiced vinegar, placed in hot oven at 400\faren, to brown.
        1. Cover tightly, reduce heat to moderately slow (325F), and cook slowly about 3 hours, or until tender.  Add more of the vinegar if necessary.
        1. Take out the meat, rest, and slice for serving.
        1. Strain liquid in the kettle, skim off the fat.
        1. Melt brown sugar in an iron skillet (like making caramel) and slowly add strained liquid.
        1. Then add raisins and ginger snaps. Cook until thickened and pour over meat.
        1. We usually have this with mashed potatoes or dumplings (potato or Semmelknoedel).
