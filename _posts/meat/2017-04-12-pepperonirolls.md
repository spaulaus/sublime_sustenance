        1. Prepare the dough as per the instructions
        1. After forming dough into the individual rolls, fold the dough around 1 slice of cheese and 2 slices of pepperoni. I generally need to fold the pieces of cheese and pepperoni up so as not to make it stretch the dough too thin.
        1. Cook as with the dinner roll recipe (350 F for 20-30 min).

A Stanley P. original!

For both the mozzarella cheese and pepperoni, I usually use the Boar's Head sandwich style stuff from the deli at 
Kroger. However, if you lay your hands on some higher quality stuff, go for it. You can also make this into one large 
delicious loaf, or substitute saut√©ed onions, peppers and sausage.
