        1. Preheat oven to 400 F.
        1. Place the flour into your food processor. Add the melted butter. Add salt and seasonings. Pulse until well blended.
        1. Add the water a tablespoon at a time until you get a ball that sticks together (be careful not to add too much water).
        1. Place dough on a floured board and roll until 1/8-inch thick. Place on cookie sheet. At this time you can dock the dough if you would like. (This keeps out some of the air bubbles)
        1. Place in an oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Watching after 10 minutes. Until light brown on out-side edges.
        1. Remove from pan and let cool completely. Break into serving size portions.

You can also just mix these up with a fork and a bowl. 1 T of butter will give you crunchy crackers, 2 T of butter will 
yield crispy. Either way, they're delicious.
