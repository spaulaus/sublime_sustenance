        1. Put flour and salt into a bowl
        1. Dissolve yeast in 1/3 of the water.
        1. Make hollow in flour, pour in yeast, stir adding more water until you form a soft dough.
        1. Beat dough until it has become smooth. Turn out on a floured board. Lift up from mixing board and slap down against board, repeating operation until dough, even while remaining soft, comes off the board easily and does not stick to the hands; by this time it should be smooth and elastic.
        1. Form dough into a ball and cut a cross into the top to help dough rise.
        1. Place into a greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk. This will take about 3 hours.
        1. Put it back on mixing board and knead again, following same procedure as before.
