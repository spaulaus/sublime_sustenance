        * 4 cups old fashioned rolled oats (not instant, quick, or steel cut)
        * 1 cup warm water (to mix sugar)
        * 1/4 cup brown sugar, honey, molasses, etc or combination of multiple "sugars"
        * dash vanilla, rum, or other aromatics (optional)

        * dried fruit (cranberries, raisins, mangoes, etc.)

        1. Pour sugar water on oats and mix with hands until all oats are moistened. Proportions are variable as oats that are very wet just take longer to dry out in oven.
        1. Spread on a lightly greased sheet of foil on a large cookie sheet and place in the oven at 300-325 F.  The oats will dry out and slowly brown 15-30 minutes depending on original wetness.
        1. With 5 more minutes to cook, add blanched almond slivers, raw sunflower seeds, raw pumpkin seeds, etc. until all are "toasted".
        1. Pull out and let cool. Add raisins, dried cranberries, or other dried fruits to taste.
        1. Mix and store in a container.

Got this one from my buddy C. Gross. In addition to tradition having with milk, it's a good sprinkle for yoghurt and 
fruit (breakfast or dessert) too.
