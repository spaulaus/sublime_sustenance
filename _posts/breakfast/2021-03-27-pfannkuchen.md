    directions_markdown: |-
        1. Scramble eggs with milk/water, flour and salt using a fork or whisk.  Pour into heated and greased frying pan.
        2. Cover with a lid or piece of foil. This will steam/cook top of pancake. Do not attempt to flip.
        3. When done (dry on top) and flecked on bottom slide onto cookie sheet.
        4. Move each pancake to cookie sheet  (I use lightly greased foil on pan to minimize clean-up) and build toppings there.
        5. Egg base can be made ahead.  It will be reheated when topped and put in the oven.
        5. Place in 350-375 F oven until throughly warm or hot and cheese is melted or top is bubbly.  Oven could be hotter if time is short.

Got this guy from Carl. He provided the following additional info.

If making a single pancake, you could top it on the stove top relying on the lid cover to adequately warm the toppings.
I’d probably not heat the lettuces, and I’ve essentially just threw salad fixings and dressing on top and made a one-plate meal.

Note I once had roast pork and sour cherry, it was surprisingly tasty.  Typical combos are:
* ham, leeks, and cheese
* ham, pineapple, and cheese
* salami, mushrooms, cheese
* onions, mushrooms, bell pepper
* spinach, bacon, feta
* tomato, feta, olives
* apple, raisons
* banana, chocolate

Note: never saw sauerkraut on a pancake so even though its German, may be don’t try it!
