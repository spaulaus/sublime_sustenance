        1. If you are using fresh red chiles - it is important that they be red, for the proper color of piri piri - chop them roughly. If you really want to make this authentic, find yourself the tiny "bird's eye" chiles, which are deliciously hot. Any hot chile will do, though.
        1. Throw everything into a food processor except the oil. Buzz on high until smooth.
        1. Once the sauce begins to get smooth, drizzle in the oil slowly while the machine is running. Once it is all incorporated, put the sauce in a glass jar and let stand at room temperature for up to a day.
        1. For longer storage, seal in a jar and keep in the fridge up to a month.
