        1. Remove all parts from the chicken cavity and rinse the chicken under cool water inside and out. Pat dry with paper towels and tie legs together with cooking string/twine. Place chicken in a roasting pan (you may place on a rack in the pan, but not entirely necessary).
        1. Mix together spices, lemon juice, and olive oil to make the rub and apply liberally all over chicken; bake uncovered for 2 hours at 350 F.
