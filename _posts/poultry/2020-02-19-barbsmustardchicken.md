        1. Pre heat oven to 350 F.
        2. Put a decent amount of each mustard into a bowl
        2. Put breadcrumbs into the bowl
        2. Add the half-and-half or cream and stir. Consistency should be a little liquidy, but you can add more cream / half-and-half or crumbs to get the consistency you want. 
        2. Season the chicken with salt
        2. Heat an oven-safe skillet to medium-high heat and add butter. Add the chicken and sprinkle with lemon juice.
        4. Brown both sides of the chicken, spooning pan juices over the meat.
        3. When the chicken is nearly cooked, add the cayenne pepper, Cajun seasoning.
        5. Smother the chicken with the mustard mixture.
        5. Put the pan in the oven and cook for another 5-10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
