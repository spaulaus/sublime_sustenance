        * 1-2 cups chopped eggplant, skin left on (OPTIONAL)
        * 2 kaffir lime leaves, OR substitute bay leaves

        1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Then place chicken pieces in a fairly large casserole dish.
        1. Pour the curry sauce over the chicken. Add the chopped eggplant (if using), plus kaffir lime leaves/bay leaf and cinnamon stick, mixing everything into the sauce. Cover and bake 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Note: if you prefer more sauce, add 1/4 to 1/3 cup good-tasting chicken stock.
        1. Remove dish from oven. Add the bell pepper and tomato, stirring them into the sauce. Return curry to the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until both chicken and vegetables are well cooked.
        1. Do a taste test, looking for a balance of flavors. If not salty or flavorful enough, add up to 1 Tbsp. more fish sauce. If too salty, add more fresh lime juice. If too sour, add a little more brown sugar. If too spicy, add more coconut milk. If not spicy enough, add a few fresh-cut chilies or dried crushed chili/cayenne pepper.
        1. Ladle the curry into a large serving bowl. Sprinkle generously with fresh basil and coriander (cilantro), and serve with plenty of Thai jasmine rice. ENJOY!
